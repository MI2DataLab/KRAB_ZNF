# KRAB-ZNF explorer - expression of KRAB-ZNF- transcription factors in The Cancer Genome Atlas study 

[KRAB-ZNF explorer](http://mi2.mini.pw.edu.pl:8080/KRAB_ZNF/) is a web-based application for analyzing the expression of KRAB-ZNF transcription factors in the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas study. 

Key functionalities cover: 

1) comparative analysis of KRAB-ZNF genes between normal and tumor samples, 
2) correlation of KRAB-ZNF expression with various clinico-pathological parameters, 
3) analysis and visualization of the link between patient survival and expression of KRAB-ZNF genes, 
4) analyses of the association between KRAB-ZNF expression and CpG methylation status, 
5) analyses of isoform expressions for KRAB-ZNF genes in normal and tumor samples, 
4) comparative analysis of KRAB-ZNF expression in normal tissues 

KRAB-ZNF explorer is developed by Rafal Cylwa and collaborators: Urszula Oleksiewicz, Marta Gladych, Kornel Kielczewski and Przemyslaw Biecek. 
Analyses are performed based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. 
R sources of the application are in this Github repository.
